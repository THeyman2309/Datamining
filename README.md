# Datamining
This repository was made to store code used in the project for the course "Datamining" by Prof. Dr. Yvan Saeys.

* The file make csv.rmd contains the code that was used to construct a .csv file from .CEL files. This was used to load the data from dataset 3 (E-MTAB-11134).
* The file figures.rmd contains the code that was used to construct the figures of the report, as well as the statistical testing that was performed.
